""" 
Idea for standardized hookup and vis of pipelines.

Requires that every segment's class takes target as the first argument to init, 
and kwargs thereafter. 

This might just be better handled by convention in writing them from scratch - use nested
parentheses and good formatting instead of a programmatic solution. The getattr(methname) is
pretty ugly, honestly. Why not simply register a list of instances and target coroutines? DRY?

segments = [(Segment, 'segment_func', {}),
            (BoundsFilter, 'filter', {'bounds':bounds}),
            (BoundsFilter, 'filter', {'bounds':bounds}),
            (Broadcast, 'broadcast', {})
           ]

End of the segment (first one inited) one does not require a target, and should be either Broadcast or an outlet.

register(segments, prior_segment=None, subsequent_segment=None)

from itertools import reversed
def register(segments, subsequent_segment=None):
    segchain = []
    seg = subsequent_segment
    for cls, meth, kws in reversed(segments):
        seg_reference = cls(subsequent_segment, **kws)
        crt = getattr(seg_reference, meth)
        seg = crt()

        segchain.append((seg_reference, seg))
        
    return segchain
